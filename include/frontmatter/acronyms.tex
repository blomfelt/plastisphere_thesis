% Comments Máté
% - Start result with summary of the data processed, how many resistance genes were mapped to card et.c. Then describe figure 2.1 which is unclear
% - Don't forget your opponent is not familiar with this topic, so "serve" your results as you would in a documentary, for a broader audience.
% - If you use the word significance, you need to add e.g. (Wilcoxon test: p < 0.05
% - Only one caption is enough for combined plots, there you can mention (a) text, and (b) text.
% - You need to be extremely clear about the differences between the mean percent mutation and the number of hits section.
% - Taxonomic names names: capitalized first letter and italics
% - mention that you collected data from various ecosysems which all had different substrates

% Máté
% - remove leaf/rock etc from all analyses
% x point mutation on either forward/reverse -> 6 dots intsead of 3
% x check coordinates, specify east/west
% x working code (notebook) as pdf in appendix
