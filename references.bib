  abstract = {The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric rank test for statistical hypothesis testing used either to test the location of a population based on a sample of data, or to compare the locations of two populations using two matched samples. The one-sample version serves a purpose similar to that of the one-sample Student's t-test. For two matched samples, it is a paired difference test like the paired Student's t-test (also known as the "t-test for matched pairs" or "t-test for dependent samples"). The Wilcoxon test is a good alternative to the  t-test when the normal distribution of the differences between paired individuals cannot be assumed. Instead, it assumes a weaker hypothesis that the distribution of this difference   is symmetric  around a central value  and it aims to test whether this center value differs significantly from zero. The Wilcoxon test is a more powerful alternative to the sign test because it considers the magnitude of the differences, but it requires this moderately strong assumption of symmetry.},

  abstract = {Assembly of metagenomic samples can provide essential information about the mobility potential and taxonomic origin of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and inform interventions to prevent further spread of resistant bacteria. However, similar to other conserved regions, such as ribosomal RNA genes and mobile genetic elements, almost identical ARGs typically occur in multiple genomic contexts across different species, representing a considerable challenge for the assembly process. Usually, this results in many fragmented contigs of unclear origin, complicating the risk assessment of ARG detections. To systematically investigate the impact of this issue on detection, quantification and contextualization of ARGs, we evaluated the performance of different assembly approaches, including genomic-, metagenomic- and transcriptomic-specialized assemblers. We quantified recovery and accuracy rates of each tool for ARGs both from in silico spiked metagenomic samples as well as real samples sequenced using both long- and short-read sequencing technologies.},

Focused curation enhancements since 2020 include expanded {$\beta$}-lactamase curation, incorporation of likelihood-based AMR mutations for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, addition of disinfectants and antiseptics plus their associated ARGs, and systematic curation of resistance-modifying agents. This expanded curation includes 180 new AMR gene families, 15 new drug classes, 1 new resistance mechanism, and two new ontological relationships: evolutionary\_variant\_of and is\_small\_molecule\_inhibitor. In silico prediction of resistomes and prevalence statistics of ARGs has been expanded to 377 pathogens, 21,079 chromosomes, 2,662 genomic islands, 41,828 plasmids~and 155,606 whole-genome shotgun assemblies, resulting in collation of 322,710 unique ARG allele sequences.

  abstract = {Background: Polymorphonuclear elastase (PMN-E) is a neutrophilic marker that has been implicated in acute inflammatory responses. Objectives: To evaluate the accuracy of PMN-E in the diagnosis of complicated pyogenic effusions. Patients and Method: We studied 536 patients with pleural effusion of various etiologies. There were 125 pyogenic bacterial effusions (42 typical parapneumonic, 17 borderline complicated parapneumonic and 66 complicated parapneumonic or empyema), 83 tuberculous, 91 malignant, 42 paramalignant, 95 transudates, 28 miscellaneous and 72 effusions of unknown origin. Classic markers (pH, glucose, proteins, adenosine deaminase, LDH, leukocytes and differential count) and the PMN-E level were quantified in pleural fluid. The accuracy of PMN-E as an early marker in the diagnosis of complicated pyogenic infectious effusions was evaluated among pleural effusions that were not diagnosed with classic biochemical markers, radiological findings or Gram stain. Since results of pleural fluid culture and cytological examination are generally available after a 48-hour delay, they were not included as early markers in the initial diagnosis of pleural effusions. Results: Early diagnosis of complicated pyogenic bacterial effusions was achieved in only 48 of 66 cases with classic markers. Among those that were not diagnosed with these parameters, a pleural PMN-E value \&gt;3,500 {\textmu}g/l discriminated between complicated and noncomplicated pyogenic bacterial effusions with a sensitivity of 67\% and a specificity of 97\%. Conclusions: PMN-E is useful in the early diagnosis and management of complicated pyogenic infectious effusions, which may be delayed with classic markers.},

Once absorbed, B12 is used as a cofactor for enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of DNA, fatty acids, and myelin. As a result, B12 deficiency can lead to hematologic and neurologic symptoms. B12 is stored in excess in the liver; however, in cases in which B12 cannot be absorbed for a prolonged period (e.g., dietary insufficiency, malabsorption, lack of intrinsic factor), hepatic stores are depleted, and deficiency occurs.},

Particularly the small subunit (               SSU               ; 16S/18S)               rRNA               gene is frequently used for species- or genus-level identification, but also the large subunit (               LSU               ; 23S/28S)               rRNA               gene is employed in taxonomic assignment. The               metaxa               software tool is a popular utility for extracting partial               rRNA               sequences from large sequencing data sets and assigning them to an archaeal, bacterial, nuclear eukaryote, mitochondrial or chloroplast origin. This study describes a comprehensive update to               metaxa               --               metaxa               2 -- that extends the capabilities of the tool, introducing support for the               LSU rRNA               gene, a greatly improved classifier allowing classification down to genus or species level, as well as enhanced support for short-read (100~bp) and paired-end sequences, among other changes. The performance of               metaxa               2 was compared to other commonly used taxonomic classifiers, showing that               metaxa               2 often outperforms previous methods in terms of making correct predictions while maintaining a low misclassification rate.               metaxa               2 is freely available from               http://microbiology.se/software/metaxa2/               .},

However, no genetic marker gives sufficient performance across all the biological kingdoms, hampering studies of taxonomic diversity in many groups of organisms. This has led to the adoption of a range of genetic markers for DNA metabarcoding. While many taxonomic classification software tools can be re-trained on these genetic markers, they are often designed with assumptions that impair their utility on genes other than the SSU and LSU rRNA. Here, we present an update to Metaxa2 that enables the use of any genetic marker for taxonomic classification of metagenome and amplicon sequence data.                                         Results               We evaluated the Metaxa2 Database Builder on 11 commonly used barcoding regions and found that while there are wide differences in performance between different genetic markers, our software performs satisfactorily provided that the input taxonomy and sequence data are of high quality.

  abstract = {Marine plastic debris has become a significant concern in ocean ecosystems worldwide. Little is known, however, about its influence on microbial community structure and function. In 2008, we surveyed microbial communities and metabolic activities in seawater and on plastic on an oceanographic expedition through the ``great Pacific garbage patch.'' The concentration of plastic particles in surface seawater within different size classes (2 to 5 mm and {$>$}5 mm) ranged from 0.35 to 3.7 particles m-3 across sampling stations. These densities and the particle size distribution were consistent with previous values reported in the North Pacific Ocean. Net community oxygen production (NCP = gross primary production - community respiration) on plastic debris was positive and so net autotrophic, whereas NCP in bulk seawater was close to zero. Scanning electron microscopy and metagenomic sequencing of plastic-attached communities revealed the dominance of a few metazoan taxa and a diverse assemblage of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic protists and bacteria. Bryozoa, Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes dominated all plastic particles, regardless of particle size. Bacteria inhabiting plastic were taxonomically distinct from the surrounding picoplankton and appeared well adapted to a surface-associated lifestyle. Genes with significantly higher abundances among plastic-attached bacteria included che genes, secretion system genes, and nifH genes, suggesting enrichment for chemotaxis, frequent cell-to-cell interactions, and nitrogen fixation. In aggregate, our findings suggest that plastic debris forms a habitat for complex microbial assemblages that have lifestyles, metabolic pathways, and biogeochemical activities that are distinct from those of free-living planktonic microbial communities. IMPORTANCE Marine plastic debris is a growing concern that has captured the general public's attention. While the negative impacts of plastic debris on oceanic macrobiota, including mammals and birds, are well documented, little is known about its influence on smaller marine residents, including microbes that have key roles in ocean biogeochemistry. Our work provides a new perspective on microbial communities inhabiting microplastics that includes its effect on microbial biogeochemical activities and a description of the cross-domain communities inhabiting plastic particles. This study is among the first molecular ecology, plastic debris biota surveys in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. It has identified fundamental differences in the functional potential and taxonomic composition of plastic-associated microbes versus planktonic microbes found in the surrounding open-ocean habitat.

  abstract = {---ADP plays a key role in hemostasis and thrombosis. Despite its early identification in 1961 as the first known aggregating agent, the molecular basis of ADP-induced platelet activation is only beginning to be understood. The present review proposes a model of 3 purinergic receptors contributing separately to the complex process of ADP-induced platelet aggregation: the P2X1 ionotropic receptor, responsible for rapid influx of ionized calcium into the cytosol; the P2Y1 metabotropic receptor, responsible for mobilization of ionized calcium from internal stores, which initiates aggregation; and an as-yet-unidentified P2Y receptor coupled to G{$\alpha$}i2, which is essential for the full aggregation response to ADP. It is probable that this as-yet-unidentified receptor is the molecular target of the ADP-selective antiaggregating drugs ticlopidine and clopidogrel. In addition, it is probably defective in patients with a bleeding diathesis that is characterized by selective impairment of platelet responses to ADP.},

The aim of this systematic review is to address the question: Which diet has the least environmental impact on our planet? A comparison of a vegan, vegetarian and omnivorous diets. This systematic review is based on 16 studies and 18 reviews. The included studies were selected by focusing directly on environmental impacts of human diets. Four electronic bibliographic databases, PubMed, Medline, Scopus and Web of Science were used to conduct a systematic literature search based on fixed inclusion and exclusion criteria. The durations of the studies ranged from 7 days to 27 years. Most were carried out in the US or Europe. Results from our review suggest that the vegan diet is the optimal diet for the environment because, out of all the compared diets, its production results in the lowest level of GHG emissions. Additionally, the reviewed studies indicate the possibility of achieving the same environmental impact as that of the vegan diet, without excluding the meat and dairy food groups, but rather, by reducing them substantially.},

New techniques based on capillary electrophoresis separation, high-performance anion exchange chromatography, and mass spectrometry are also presented. Since results depend heavily on the quality of the sample, most contributors have devoted a section to sample preparation, particularly to the collection and storage of bodily fluids. A new method for desalting samples prior to hydrolysis is also provided. Each method is described in step-by-step detail to ensure successful experimental results, and contains helpful notes on pitfalls to avoid, and variations that enable the methods to be used with different systems.

  abstract = {Adequate hemostasis during surgical procedures is essential for successful patient outcomes and reduced healthcare resource utilization. Topical hemostatic agents can act as catalysts for the clotting cascade or as a scaffold to promote platelet activation or aggregation. Although an ever-increasing number of topical absorbable hemostatic agents are now available for perioperative use, health care providers are disadvantaged by the lack of comparative data on feasibility, clinical effectiveness, advantages, and limitations of each in specific surgical settings. This knowledge is important for appropriate product choice when patient characteristics, type of surgical procedure, type of bleeding, and product availability may differ widely. This manuscript provides the first comprehensive overview of Avitene™ Microfibrillar Collagen Hemostat (MCH), a bovine collagen-based absorbable hemostat that has been widely used for over four decades in the United States and abroad. MCH is indicated as an adjunct to hemostasis across a broad spectrum of surgical specialties and has been shown to achieve hemostasis with positive patient outcomes and a favorable safety profile in many applications, including hepatic, orthopedic, splenic, oral, and otolaryngologic surgery. Although published clinical data regarding the use of MCH in cardiovascular surgery is limited, evidence suggests moderate use in this specialty. The information contained in this systematic review will help health care providers understand the clinical use and effectiveness of the product to determine appropriate use in differing bleeding scenarios across multiple surgical specialties. Future studies may include comparative functional and cost analyses to explore the economic advantages of using absorbable hemostatic agents compared with each other or with conventional techniques of hemostasis, when appropriate.},

  abstract = {The MITOchondrial genome database of metaZOAns (MitoZoa) is a public resource for comparative analyses of metazoan mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) at both the sequence and genomic organizational levels. The main characteristics of the MitoZoa database are the careful revision of mtDNA entry annotations and the possibility of retrieving gene order and non-coding region (NCR) data in appropriate formats. The MitoZoa retrieval system enables basic and complex queries at various taxonomic levels using different search menus. MitoZoa 2.0 has been enhanced in several aspects, including: a re-annotation pipeline to check the correctness of protein-coding gene predictions; a standardized annotation of introns and of precursor ORFs whose functionality is post-transcriptionally recovered by RNA editing or programmed translational frameshifting; updates of taxon-related fields and a BLAST sequence similarity search tool. Database novelties and the definition of standard mtDNA annotation rules, together with the user-friendly retrieval system and the BLAST service, make MitoZoa a valuable resource for comparative and evolutionary analyses as well as a reference database to assist in the annotation of novel mtDNA sequences. MitoZoa is freely accessible at http://www.caspur.it/mitozoa.},

Results: UBLAST and USEARCH are new algorithms enabling sensitive local and global search of large sequence databases at exceptionally high speeds. They are often orders of magnitude faster than BLAST in practical applications, though sensitivity to distant protein relationships is lower. UCLUST is a new clustering method that exploits USEARCH to assign sequences to clusters. UCLUST offers several advantages over the widely used program CD-HIT, including higher speed, lower memory use, improved sensitivity, clustering at lower identities and classification of much larger datasets.

MultiQC can plot data from many common bioinformatics tools and is built to allow easy extension and customization.Availability and implementation: MultiQC is available with an GNU GPLv3 license on GitHub, the Python Package Index and Bioconda.

Vitamin B12 biosynthesis is confined to few bacteria and archaea, and as such its production relies on microbial fermentation. Rational strain engineering is dependent on efficient genetic tools and a detailed knowledge of metabolic pathways, regulation of which can be applied to improve product yield. Recent advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering have been used to efficiently construct many microbial chemical factories. Many published reviews have probed the vitamin B12 biosynthetic pathway. To maximize the potential of microbes for vitamin B12 production, new strategies and tools are required. In this review, we provide a comprehensive understanding of advances in the microbial production of vitamin B12, with a particular focus on establishing a heterologous host for the vitamin B12 production, as well as on strategies and tools that have been applied to increase microbial cobalamin production. Several worthy strategies employed for other products are also included.},

  abstract = {In this study, introduction of a viable cell sensor and electronic nose into ethanol fermentation was investigated, which could be used in real-time and on-line monitoring of the amount of living cells and product content, respectively. Compared to the conventional off-line biomass determination, the capacitance value exhibited a completely consistent trend with colony forming units, indicating that the capacitance value could reflect the living cells in the fermentation broth. On the other hand, in comparison to the results of off-line determination by high-performance liquid chromatography, the ethanol concentration measured by electronic nose presented an excellent consistency, so as to realize the on-line monitoring during the whole process. On this basis, a dynamic feeding strategy of glucose guided by the changes of living cells and ethanol content was developed. And consequently, the ethanol concentration, productivity and yield were enhanced by 15.4\%, 15.9\% and 9.0\%, respectively. The advanced sensors adopted herein to monitor the key parameters of ethanol fermentation process could be readily extended to an industrial scale and other similar fermentation processes.},

Protein supplementation in the form of beverages began as low-cost by-products of oil and cheese manufacturing processes and it became available as raw materials for commercial soy and dairy protein products initially targeted to bodybuilders. By 2015 the combined categories of hardcore drink mixes and sports drinks tallied more than seven billion dollars in the United States. Initially a niche market is where the products were consumed primarily by athletes and sports enthusiasts; in the later part of the 2000s the categories saw mainstream appeal with world class multinational companies launching their own mass-marketed nutritional beverages.},

PPO activity initially increased and then decreased with heat, following a first order kinetic model. Increase in activity indicated presence of latent PPO. Regression coefficients for the linear portions of inactivation curves were computed to determine inactivation parameters. Reaction data at 78{$^\circ$}C revealed that PPO in Amasya was the least and Starking Delicious the most heat-stable. Rate constants for heat inactivation at 78{$^\circ$}C ranged from 15.99--28.27. 10-2 min-1. Activation energies varied between 54.7--77.2 kcal. mol-1 with z values of 7.1--10.0C{$^\circ$}.PPO in apples was generally more heat-stable than PPO in most fruits.},

  abstract = {Enzyme biocatalysis for plastic treatment and recycling is an emerging field of growing interest. However, it is challenging and time-consuming to identify plastic-degrading enzymes with desirable functionality, given the large number of putative enzyme sequences. There is a critical need to develop an effective approach to accurately predict the enzyme activity in degrading different types of plastics. In this study, we developed a machine-learning-based plastic enzymatic degradation (PED) framework to predict the ability of an enzyme to degrade plastics of interest by exploring and recognizing hidden patterns in protein sequences. A data set integrating information from a wide range of experimentally verified enzymes and various common plastic substrates was created. A new context-aware enzyme sequence representation (CESR) mechanism was developed to learn the abundant contextual information in enzyme sequences, and feature extraction was performed for enzymes at both the amino acid level and global sequence level. Thirteen machine learning classification algorithms were compared, and XGBoost was identified as the best-performing algorithm. PED achieved an overall accuracy of 90.2\% and outperformed sequence-based protein classification models from the existing literature. Furthermore, important enzyme features in plastic degradation were identified and comprehensively interpreted.

  abstract = {Background The growing advances in DNA sequencing tools have made analyzing the human genome cheaper and faster. While such analyses are intended to identify complex variants, related to disease susceptibility and efficacy of drug responses, they have blurred the definitions of mutation and polymorphism. Discussion In the era of personal genomics, it is critical to establish clear guidelines regarding the use of a reference genome. Nowadays DNA variants are called as differences in comparison to a reference. In a sequencing project Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA mutations are defined as DNA variants detectable in {$>$}1~\% or {$<$}1~\% of the population, respectively. The alternative use of the two terms mutation or polymorphism for the same event (a difference as compared with a reference) can lead to problems of classification. These problems can impact the accuracy of the interpretation and the functional relationship between a disease state and a genomic sequence. Summary We propose to solve this nomenclature dilemma by defining mutations as DNA variants obtained in a paired sequencing project including the germline DNA of the same individual as a reference. Moreover, the term mutation should be accompanied by a qualifying prefix indicating whether the mutation occurs only in somatic cells (somatic mutation) or also in the germline (germline mutation). We believe this distinction in definition will help avoid confusion among researchers and support the practice of sequencing the germline and somatic tissues in parallel to classify the DNA variants thus defined as mutations.},

  abstract = {Background Sports nutrition is a constantly evolving field with hundreds of research papers published annually. In the year 2017 alone, 2082 articles were published under the key words `sport nutrition'. Consequently, staying current with the relevant literature is often difficult. Methods This paper is an ongoing update of the sports nutrition review article originally published as the lead paper to launch the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition in 2004 and updated in 2010. It presents a well-referenced overview of the current state of the science related to optimization of training and performance enhancement through exercise training and nutrition. Notably, due to the accelerated pace and size at which the literature base in this research area grows, the topics discussed will focus on muscle hypertrophy and performance enhancement. As such, this paper provides an overview of: 1.) How ergogenic aids and dietary supplements are defined in terms of governmental regulation and oversight; 2.) How dietary supplements are legally regulated in the United States; 3.) How to evaluate the scientific merit of nutritional supplements; 4.) General nutritional strategies to optimize performance and enhance recovery; and, 5.) An overview of our current understanding of nutritional approaches to augment skeletal muscle hypertrophy and the potential ergogenic value of various dietary and supplemental approaches. Conclusions This updated review is to provide ISSN members and individuals interested in sports nutrition with information that can be implemented in educational, research or practical settings and serve as a foundational basis for determining the efficacy and safety of many common sport nutrition products and their ingredients.},

Although excellent reviews have been published on next-generation sequencing, its associated bioinformatics challenges, and the applications of SNPs in genetic studies, a comprehensive review connecting these three intertwined research areas is needed. This paper touches upon various aspects of SNP discovery, highlighting key points in availability and selection of appropriate sequencing platforms, bioinformatics pipelines, SNP filtering criteria, and applications of SNPs in genetic analyses. The use of next-generation sequencing methodologies in many non-model crops leading to discovery and implementation of SNPs in various genetic studies is discussed. Development and improvement of bioinformatics software that are open source and freely available have accelerated the SNP discovery while reducing the associated cost. Key considerations for SNP filtering and associated pipelines are discussed in specific topics. A list of commonly used software and their sources is compiled for easy access and reference.},

Vitamin B12 deficiency is more prevalent in vegans and being water-soluble, maintaining its adequate levels in the body is a challenging task. Consumption of vitamin B12 fortified functional foods is an effective strategy to minimize its deficiency in human beings, particularly in vegans. Industrial production of vitamin B12 is primarily carried out through microbial fermentation since its production is confined only to bacteria and archaea. Recent advances in metabolic engineering have enabled to engineer microbes with strong promoters, expression vectors, and gene amplification that have transformed microbes into efficient microbial cell factories for the production of vitamin B12. Fermentation process optimization including substrate optimization, precursor supplementation, controlled oxygenation and identifying growth limiting factors have further enabled to adopt effective strategies to enhance its yield. In this review, a comprehensive information on the recent advancements in studies on microbial production, synthesis pathways and absorption mechanism of vitamin B12 along with therapeutic health benefits are highlighted.},

  abstract = {Abstract             For decades, the industrial vitamin B12 (cobalamin) production has been based on bacterial producer strains. Due to limited methods for strain optimization and difficult strain handling, the desire for new vitamin B12-producing hosts has risen. As a vitamin B12-independent organism with a big toolbox for genomic engineering and easy-to-handle cultivation conditions, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has high potential for heterologous vitamin B12 production. However, the B12 synthesis pathway is long and complex. To be able to easily engineer and evolve B12-producing recombinant yeast cells, we have developed an S. cerevisiae strain whose growth is dependent on vitamin B12. For this, the B12-independent methionine synthase Met6 of yeast was replaced by a B12-dependent methionine synthase MetH from Escherichia coli. Adaptive laboratory evolution, RT-qPCR, and overexpression experiments show that additional high-level expression of a bacterial flavodoxin/ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (Fpr-FldA) system is essential for in vivo reactivation of MetH activity and growth. Growth of MetH-containing yeast cells on methionine-free media is only possible with the addition of adenosylcobalamin or methylcobalamin. A heterologous vitamin B12 transport system turned out to be not necessary for the uptake of cobalamins. This strain should be a powerful chassis to engineer B12-producing yeast cells.},

  abstract = {Continuous disposal of plastic waste and its accretion in the environment is the biggest challenge the world has ever faced. Breaking its terrestrial bounds, plastic waste has now extended its outreach to aquatic territories including marine ecosystems. Photooxidation-mediated partial degradation converts plastic polymers to micrometric dimensions, thus augmenting their biomagnification in the food chains. Besides contaminating the food chains, microplastics also act as potential carriers of pollutants and pathogenic microbes. The slow and inefficient biodegradation of plastic by microorganisms in their natural habitats offers an opportunity to explore biotechnological interventions to overcome and mitigate the hazardous effects of plastic waste. Microorganisms utilize plastic polymer as a carbon source thus deriving energy from its oxidation and mineralization. The whole microbial consortium in the plastisphere interacts during the biodegradation process. The emergence of these novel plastic-dwelling microbial communities makes plastic degradation a very complex and finetuned process, where the expression of novel plastic-degrading genes and resultant pathways and interaction networks all contribute towards biodegradation. Thus, it is quite challenging to study such vast consortia of microbial communities by conventional approach to fully understand the degradation pattern of plastics. The techniques like shotgun metagenomics, transcriptomics and meta transcriptomics, next-generation amplicon sequencing, proteomics and metaproteomic, etc. have been successfully employed in recent years for identifying novel microbial species, gene pool, interactions network, and reaction pathways from different microbial consortia. Among several classes of bacteria, the Flavobacteriaceae, Rhodobacteriaceae, and Phycobactereaceae have shown their remarkable presence in different plastisphere. Omics approaches have also revealed high-level expression of plastic-degrading enzymes like esterases, depolymerases, hydrolases, and reductases. The applicability of these techniques in context to the studies of microbiota in the degradation of plastics is defined by their high accuracy, quickness, and sensitivity. The current review accentuates the significance of omics-based studies in identifying specific microbiota, dynamic gene pool, functional pathways, and metabolic networks of the plastisphere microbial consortia.},

By integrating whole-genome sequencing, bioinformatics, classical genetics and genome-editing techniques, evolutionary engineering has also become a powerful approach for identification and reverse engineering of molecular mechanisms that underlie industrially relevant traits. New techniques enable acceleration of in vivo mutation rates, both across yeast genomes and at specific loci. Recent studies indicate that phenotypic trade-offs, which are often observed after evolution under constant conditions, can be mitigated by using dynamic cultivation regimes. Advances in research on synthetic regulatory circuits offer exciting possibilities to extend the applicability of evolutionary engineering to products of yeasts whose synthesis requires a net input of cellular energy.},

  abstract = {Health authorities increasingly recommend a more plant-based diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, pulses, whole grains and nuts, low in red meat and moderate in dairy, eggs, poultry and fish which will be beneficial for both health and the environment. A systematic review of observational and intervention studies published between 2000 and January 2020 was conducted to assess nutrient intake and status in adult populations consuming plant-based diets (mainly vegetarian and vegan) with that of meat-eaters. Mean intake of nutrients were calculated and benchmarked to dietary reference values. For micronutrient status, mean concentrations of biomarkers were calculated and compared across diet groups. A total of 141 studies were included, mostly from Europe, South/East Asia, and North America. Protein intake was lower in people following plant-based diets compared to meat-eaters, but well within recommended intake levels. While fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), folate, vitamin C, E and magnesium intake was higher, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intake was lower in vegetarians and vegans as compared to meat-eaters. Intake and status of vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron, zinc, iodine, calcium and bone turnover markers were generally lower in plant-based dietary patterns compared to meat-eaters. Vegans had the lowest vitamin B12, calcium and iodine intake, and also lower iodine status and lower bone mineral density. Meat-eaters were at risk of inadequate intakes of fiber, PUFA, {$\alpha$}-linolenic acid (ALA), folate, vitamin D, E, calcium and magnesium. There were nutrient inadequacies across all dietary patterns, including vegan, vegetarian and meat-based diets. As plant-based diets are generally better for health and the environment, public health strategies should facilitate the transition to a balanced diet with more diverse nutrient-dense plant foods through consumer education, food fortification and possibly supplementation.},

Fish were filleted and divided into three groups. First group was used as the control (C) without rosemary extract, second group was treated with 1\% rosemary extracts (10 g L-1) for 2 min (R1), and the third was treated with 2\% rosemary extracts (20 g L-1) for 2 min (R2). Thirty fillets per litre were used. After that, all groups were vacuum-packed in polyethylene bags. The samples were stored in the refrigerator condition (4 {\textpm} 1 {$^\circ$}C) over the storage period of 20 days. The results showed that the use of rosemary extract improved the sensory quality of both raw and cooked sardine, most preferably sardine treated with 1\% of rosemary. Biochemical analysis showed that the use of 2\% of rosemary extract were found to be most effective (P {$<$} 0.05) in controlling the rate of lipid oxidation.},

  abstract = {Ketoconazole (KT) and fluconazole (FLU) are azole antifungal agents with a broad spectrum of activity against both superficial and systemic mycoses. KT is also an anticancer agent in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. In many clinical and retrospective studies, KT has been reported to cause liver damage, i.e. chemical hepatitis. Histologie analysis of KT induced hepatotoxicity shows massive centrilobular necrosis in which the hepatotoxicity was not thought to be mediated through an immunoallergic mechanism. According to the medical literature, the pattern of hepatic injury appears to be primarily of the hepatocellular type. Because of the documented reports of KT and FLU hepatotoxicity, a cytotoxicity comparison of KT and FLU was implemented. The objective of this comparison was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of these azoles such that future mechanistic investigations of hepatotoxicity could be performed. The relative hepatotoxicity of KT and FLU was evaluated using primary cultures of postnatal rat hepatocytes. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by measuring the leakage of the cytosolic enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), into the medium; by assessing mitochondrial reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT); by assessing lysosomal uptake of neutral red (NR); and by gross morphology (phase contrast microscopy). The cultures were exposed to various concentrations of KT (56--188 {$\mu$}M) for 0.5--4 h and to various concentrations of FLU (50 {$\mu$}M to 1.0 mM) for 0.5--6 h. There was a significant increase (P {$<$} 0.05) in LDH leakage and a large decrease in MTT reduction and lysosomal uptake of NR at 4 h for KT. One millimolar FLU had minimal effects on the LDH leakage and MTT reduction. These results demonstrate that KT is a more potent cytotoxicant than FLU; and its toxicity was expressed in a dose- and time-dependent manner.},

In this study traditional packaging, vacuum packaging, ascorbic acid solution (0.5 \%) and citric acid solution (0.5 \%) were considered as treatments. Rancidity development was measured by several biochemical indicators including Free Fatty Acids, Peroxide values and Thiobarbituric acid. Also pH, expressible moisture and sensory properties were measured during 6 months storage. Results showed that free fatty acid (FFA), primary and secondary oxidation products of control samples were significantly higher than those in other treatments (p{$<$}0.05). Also, expressible moisture and pH value of treated samples were significantly lower than those in control (p{$<$}0.05). However both antioxidants (AA and CA) extended shelf life of frozen fillets but rancidity development in CA treated samples was higher than other samples during storage. Results showed that all three treatments had significant effect on delaying lipid oxidation (p{$<$}0.05) but usage of AA and vacuum packaging had the best effect on delaying lipid oxidation and increasing shelf-life of fillets (p{$<$}0.05) . Thus the employment of AA and vacuum packaging alone or in combination with other protective strategies is recommended.},

Continuous disposal of plastic waste in open environments such as water bodies and landfills have a severe impact on the ecosystem which results in environmental pollution. This untreated disposal of low and high molecular weight plastics is a major environmental concern. These polymers are highly recalcitrant; hence, this global problem of plastic pollution needs urgent attention. This further warrants the exploration of an efficient, eco-friendly, and cost-effective approach to plastic degradation. In the past few years, some of the findings have explored the idea of the degradation of plastics using diverse microbial groups viz., fungi, bacteria, and algae. However, it was found that previously identified microbial agents and their secreted enzymes showed low efficiencies in plastic degradation. So far, in most of the studies, microbial species were isolated from the soil samples collected from plastic dumpsites but there might be several unexplored microbial species that can have greater efficiency to degrade plastics. Such microbial species are still unexplored because of their uncultivable nature in the lab conditions. However, advancements in bioinformatics and sequencing techniques allow rapid metagenomic screening of microbial communities along with the mining of related enzymes and genes involved in biodegradation. Therefore, exploring uncultivable microbial communities through metagenomics could serve as a great tool to find efficient plastic degrading genes and enzymes.},

Because a previous randomized, controlled study in a small cohort could not demonstrate the effectiveness of MPH in breast surgery, we evaluated their effectiveness in surgery for breast cancer in a larger cohort. Methods Medical records of 352 patients who underwent total mastectomy for breast cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data were compared between 126 patients who received MPH during surgery (MPH group) and 226 who did not (control group) according to surgical procedures. Patients were significantly older in the MPH group than in the control group because of selection bias, but other factors, such as body mass index and number of dissected lymph nodes, did not differ between groups. Results When analyzed by use of axillary manipulation, the drain placement period and drainage volume were significantly less in the MPH group than in the control group for patients with mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Only drainage volume was significantly less in the MPH group for patients with mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. The frequency of total postoperative complications, such as seroma requiring puncture, did not differ between groups. Conclusions Use of MPH may decrease the postoperative drainage volume and drain placement period in mastectomy for patients with breast cancer.},

Whilst the impact of each of these contaminants has been studied in isolation, the influence of this co-occurrence in driving antimicrobial resistance (AMR)11Abbreviations: AMR: antimicrobial resistance; ARB: antimicrobial resistant bacteria; ARG(s): antimicrobial resistance gene(s); E. coli: Escherichia coli; HGT: horizontal gene transfer; MGE(s): mobile genetic element(s); QS: quorum sensing. in microplastic-adhered microbial communities, known as `the Plastisphere', is not well understood. This review proposes the mechanisms by which interactions between antimicrobials and microplastics may drive selection for AMR in the Plastisphere. These include: 1) increased rates of horizontal gene transfer in the Plastisphere compared with free-living counterparts and natural substrate controls due to the proximity of cells, co-occurrence of environmental microplastics with AMR selective compounds and the sequestering of extracellular antibiotic resistance genes in the biofilm matrix. 2) An elevated AMR selection pressure in the Plastisphere due to the adsorbing of AMR selective or co-selective compounds to microplastics at concentrations greater than those found in surrounding mediums and potentially those adsorbed to comparator particles. 3) AMR selection pressure may be further elevated in the Plastisphere due to the incorporation of antimicrobial or AMR co-selective chemicals in the plastic matrix during manufacture. Implications for both ecological functioning and environmental risk assessments are discussed, alongside recommendations for further research.},

Here, we present cryo-EM structures of human HCA2-Gi and HCA3-Gi signaling complexes binding with multiple compounds bound. Agonists were revealed to form a salt bridge with arginine, which is conserved in the HCA family, to activate these receptors. Extracellular regions of the receptors form a lid-like structure that covers the ligand-binding pocket. Although transmembrane (TM) 6 in HCAs undergoes dynamic conformational changes, ligands do not directly interact with amino acids in TM6, suggesting that indirect signaling induces a slight shift in TM6 to activate Gi proteins. Structural analyses of agonist-bound HCA2 and HCA3 together with mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulation provide molecular insights into HCA ligand recognition and activation mechanisms.},

Microbes have emerged as a promising tool in the combating against microplastic contamination. However, the complex relationship between microbes and microplastics presents both opportunities and challenges, leading to a nuanced understanding of their applications in degradation. This paper provides critical insights into the multifaceted roles of different microorganisms in microplastic degradation. It begins by highlighting the `good' aspects, where several strains of microorganisms show the potential to break down microplastics through enzymatic activities and the formation of biofilms. Conversely, the `bad' aspects of microbial involvement in microplastic degradation are examined. Microorganisms can facilitate the transport and bioaccumulation of microplastics in various ecosystems, potentially exacerbating their harmful effects. The `ugly' side of microplastic degradation includes the production of harmful byproducts during microbial breakdown, raising concerns about secondary pollution and toxicity. The concept of plastisphere is discussed in this context, focusing on the phototrophs, photoheterotrophs and heterotrophs. Novel technologies involving microbial degradation of microplastics are also explained. The work emphasises the need for a comprehensive and balanced approach regarding the application of microorganisms in microplastic degradation and remediation.},

  abstract = {Plastic pollution is a major concern in marine environment as it takes many years to degrade and is one of the greatest threats to marine life. Plastic surface, referred to as plastisphere, provides habitat for growth and proliferation of various microorganisms. The discovery of these microbes is necessary to identify significant genes, enzymes and bioactive compounds that could help in bioremediation and other commercial applications. Conventional culture techniques have been successful in identifying few microbes from these habitats, leaving majority of them yet to be explored. As such, to recognize the vivid genetic diversity of microbes residing in plastisphere, their structure and corresponding ecological roles within the ecosystem, an emerging technique, called metagenomics has been explored. The technique is expected to provide hitherto unknown information on microbes from the plastisphere. Metagenomics along with next generation sequencing provides comprehensive knowledge on microbes residing in plastisphere that identifies novel microbes for plastic bioremediation, bioactive compounds and other potential benefits. The following review summarizes the efficiency of metagenomics and next generation sequencing technology over conventionally used methods for culturing microbes. It attempts to illustrate the workflow mechanism of metagenomics to elucidate diverse microbial profiles. Further, importance of integrated multi-omics techniques has been highlighted in discovering microbial ecology residing on plastisphere for wider applications.},

Six groups of texture attributes were generated and used by the sensory panel. These were related to: viscosity, surface feel, bulk homogeneity, adhesion/cohesion, wetness-dryness and fat. Two groups of nontextural mouthfeel attributes were found to be relevant, which were related to perceived temperature and oral irritation. The importance of the attributes for each product category is discussed.}

  abstract = {Microplastics have been found to be ubiquitous in freshwater ecosystems, providing a novel substrate for biofilm formation. Here, we incubated biofilm on microplastics and two natural substrates (rock and leaf) under a controlled environment to investigate the differences of microbial community structure, antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles, and ARG microbial hosts between biofilms on three types of substrates. Results from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene revealed that microplastic biofilm had a distinctive community structure. Network analyses suggested that microplastic biofilm possessed the highest node connected community, but with lower average path length, network diameter and modularity compared with biofilm on two natural particles. Metagenomic analyses further revealed microplastic biofilm with broad-spectrum and distinctive resistome. Specifically, according to taxonomic annotation of ARG microbial hosts, two opportunisitic human pathogens (Pseudomonas monteilii, Pseudomonas mendocina) and one plant pathogen (Pseudomonas syringae) were detected only in the microplastic biofilm, but not in biofilms formed on natural substrates. Our findings suggest that microplastic is a novel microbial niche and may serve as a vector for ARGs and pathogens to new environment in river water, generating freshwater environmental risk and exerting adverse impacts on human health.},

  abstract = {The great threat of microbes carried by ballast water calls for figuring out the species composition of the ballast-tank microbial community, where the dark, cold, and anoxic tank environment might select special taxa. In this study, we reconstructed 103 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including 102 bacteria and one archaea, from four vessels on international voyages. Of these MAGs, 60 were `near complete' (completeness {$>$}90\%), 34 were {$>$}80\% complete, and nine were {$>$}75\% complete. Phylogenomic analysis revealed that over 70\% (n\,=\,74) of these MAGs represented new taxa at different taxonomical levels, including one order, three families, 12 genera, and 58 species. The species composition of these MAGs was most consistent with the previous reports, with the most abundant phyla being Proteobacteria (n\,=\,69), Bacteroidota (n\,=\,17), and Actinobacteriota (n\,=\,7). These draft genomes provided novel data on species diversity and function in the ballast-tank microbial community, which will facilitate ballast water and sediments management.},

  abstract = {Yeasts are eukaryotic, single-celled microorganisms classified as members of the fungus kingdom. The first yeast originated hundreds of millions of years ago, and at least 1,500 species are currently recognized. They are estimated to constitute 1\% of all described fungal species.Some yeast species have the ability to develop multicellular characteristics by forming strings of connected budding cells known as pseudohyphae or false hyphae, or quickly evolve into a multicellular cluster with specialised cell organelles function. Yeast sizes vary greatly, depending on species and environment, typically measuring 3--4 {\textmu}m in diameter, although some yeasts can grow to 40 {\textmu}m in size. Most yeasts reproduce asexually by mitosis, and many do so by the asymmetric division process known as budding. With their single-celled growth habit, yeasts can be contrasted with molds, which grow hyphae. Fungal species that can take both forms (depending on temperature or other conditions) are called dimorphic fungi. The yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae converts carbohydrates to carbon dioxide and alcohols through the process of fermentation. The products of this reaction have been used in baking and the production of alcoholic beverages for thousands of years. S. cerevisiae is also an important model organism in modern cell biology research, and is one of the most thoroughly studied eukaryotic microorganisms. Researchers have cultured it in order to understand the biology of the eukaryotic cell and ultimately human biology in great detail. Other species of yeasts, such as Candida albicans, are opportunistic pathogens and can cause infections in humans. Yeasts have recently been used to generate electricity in microbial fuel cells and to produce ethanol for the biofuel industry. Yeasts do not form a single taxonomic or phylogenetic grouping. The term "yeast" is often taken as a synonym for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but the phylogenetic diversity of yeasts is shown by their placement in two separate phyla: the Ascomycota and the Basidiomycota. The budding yeasts or "true yeasts" are classified in the order Saccharomycetales, within the phylum Ascomycota.},

  abstract = {Plastic pollution in the ocean is a global environmental hazard aggravated by poor management of plastic waste and growth of annual plastic consumption. Microbial communities colonizing the plastic's surface, the plastisphere, has gained global interest resulting in numerous efforts to characterize the plastisphere. However, there are insufficient studies deciphering the underlying metabolic processes governing the function of the plastisphere and the plastic they reside upon. Here, we collected plastic and seawater samples from Ashmore Reef in Australia to examine the planktonic microbes and plastic associated biofilm (PAB) to investigate the ecological impact, pathogenic potential, and plastic degradation capabilities of PAB in Ashmore Reef, as well as the role and impact of bacteriophages on PAB. Using high-throughput metagenomic sequencing, we demonstrated distinct microbial communities between seawater and PAB. Similar numbers of pathogenic bacteria were found in both sample types, yet plastic and seawater select for different pathogen populations. Virulence Factor analysis further illustrated stronger pathogenic potential in PAB, highlighting the pathogenicity of environmental PAB. Furthermore, functional analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways revealed xenobiotic degradation and fatty acid degradation to be enriched in PABs. In addition, construction of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAG) and functional analysis further demonstrated the presence of a complete Polyethylene (PE) degradation pathway in multiple Proteobacteria MAGs, especially in Rhodobacteriaceae sp. Additionally, we identified viral population presence in PAB, revealing the key role of bacteriophages in shaping these communities within the PAB. Our result provides a comprehensive overview of the various ecological processes shaping microbial community on marine plastic debris.},

  abstract = {N-propanol is an important precursor in industrial antibiotic erythromycin fermentation by Saccharopolyspora erythraea. However, the online control of n-propanol concentration is a challenging problem, and hardly any effective methods have been applied in the fermentation process. In this study, an innovative method developed for on-line detection and feedback control of n-propanol concentration in erythromycin fermentation process with electronic nose. The models for n-propanol detection based on the response of the electronic nose were established, and the on-line monitoring feedback system for n-propanol concentration controlling strategy was applied in erythromycin fermentation. The effects of different residual n-propanol concentration in fermentation broth on physiological metabolism of S. erythraea were investigated in a 50-L bioreactor. The results revealed that maintaining an n-propanol concentration of 1000{\textpm}38ppm, detected by electronic nose, resulted in the highest erythromycin yield (8500U/mL). In conclusion, real-time detection and feedback control of n-propanol concentration using electronic nose is an effective method for erythromycin fermentation processes and a new precursor adding optimization process was developed.},
